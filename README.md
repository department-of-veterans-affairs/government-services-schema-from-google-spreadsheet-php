Government Services Schema From Google Spreadsheet in PHP
=========================================================

This is a simple PHP script for pulling data from a Google Spreadsheet template and generating a JSON-LD schema for representing government services.

Right now this work using a Google spreadsheet of locations and services for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eventually I will clean up and make more generic, so the template can be easily used by any government agency.

Here is the working spreadsheet - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmRmiTou7vbjdGtqM193ajJuVTFidnNVMU9IRkdtZWc#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmRmiTou7vbjdGtqM193ajJuVTFidnNVMU9IRkdtZWc#gid=0)
